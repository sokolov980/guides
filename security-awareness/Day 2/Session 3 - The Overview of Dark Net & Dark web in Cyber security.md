# **Data Breach, Ransomware & Dark Web**

---

## **What is Data?**
**Data** can be defined as a representation of facts, concepts, or instructions in a formalized manner, which should be suitable for communication, interpretation, or processing by human or machine.

---

## **Types of Data**
- **Data at Rest**: Data stored on devices (e.g., hard drives, cloud storage).
- **Data in Transit**: Data actively transmitted over networks.
- **Data in Use**: Data being processed or manipulated.

---

## **Data Classifications**
### **Classifications of Data**
1. **Personal Data**  
   - Information about an identifiable individual (e.g., email, phone number, etc.).
  
2. **Sensitive Personal Data**  
   - Includes health, financial, sexual orientation, biometric data, and more.
  
3. **Critical Sensitive Data**  
   - Requires a higher degree of protection (e.g., Aadhar, financial data).

---

## **Ransomware**
### **Ransomware**
- **Definition**: Malware that locks or encrypts your data and demands a ransom.
- **Types of Ransomware**:
  1. **Encryption Ransomware**
  2. **Lock Screen Ransomware**
  3. **MBR Ransomware**
  4. **Mobile Device Ransomware** (Android)

**Example**:  
- **Mumbai Container Terminal Hit by Ransomware** (Feb 2022).

---

## **Data Breach vs. Data Leak**
### **Data Breach** vs **Data Leak**
- **Data Breach**: Unauthorized access or theft of sensitive data.
- **Data Leak**: Accidental exposure of sensitive data (e.g., lost hard drives).

---

## **Data Breach Trends**
### **Data Breach Trends**
- **Main Targets**:  
   - Businesses, financial institutions, healthcare, and government sectors.
- **Data Types**:  
   - Email addresses, phone numbers, medical reports, trade secrets, intellectual property.
- **Rise in incidents**:  
   - More incidents of breaches and leaks affecting Indian organizations.

---

## **Causes of Data Breach**
### **Common Causes**
- **Security Misconfiguration**:  
   - Poorly configured network, incorrect file permissions, careless uploads.
- **Application Vulnerabilities**:  
   - System flaws or weaknesses in the system.
- **Weak/Default/Stolen Credentials**:  
   - Default credentials, stolen passwords, poorly configured VPN.
- **Insider Threat**:  
   - Misconfigured staff, disgruntled employees, or compromised users.

---

## **Data Breach & Dark Web**
### **Connection of Data Breach with the Dark Web**
- Stolen data often ends up on the **Dark Web** where it is sold or traded.
- **Ransomware-as-a-service** and **cybercriminal activity** thrive here.

---

## **Privacy & Anonymity**
### **Privacy**
- **Information privacy** is the right of individuals to have control over how their personal data is collected and used.
  
### **Anonymity**
- **Anonymity on the Internet** means protecting a person's identity while interacting online, typically via technologies like **TOR**.

---

## **Dark Web**
### **What is the Dark Web?**
- The **Dark Web** is part of the **Internet** that is intentionally hidden and can only be accessed with specific software (like **TOR**).
- **TOR** (The Onion Router) is a network that allows for anonymous communication.

**Dark Web Examples**:  
  - TOR, Freenet, I2P, JonDonym

---

## **Cyber Threats from the Dark Web**
### **Cyber Threats**
- **Individuals**: Defamation, harassment, identity theft.
- **Organizations**:  
  - Infection or attacks (malware, DDoS, phishing), data breaches, espionage.
- **Government & Law Enforcement**:  
  - Cybercrime, financial fraud, hacking, terrorism, illegal data markets.

---

## **What to Do During a Data Breach**
- **Disconnect** the compromised system from the Internet (without turning it off).
- **Reset credentials** for all accounts, including service accounts.
- **Report** the breach to CERT-In (Incident Response).
- **Notify** users/customers of the breach and the steps being taken to mitigate it.

---

## **Preventing Data Breach / Data Leak**
### **Prevention**
- **Incident Response Plan**: Develop a detailed plan with roles and responsibilities.
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data both **at rest** and **in transit**.
- **Access Control**: Implement strong password policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

---

## **Data Security Practices**
### **Security Measures**
1. **Stop using TOR** for unauthorized activities.
2. **Develop a blacklist** of TOR nodes.
3. **Block traffic** from suspicious sources.

---

## **Dark Web vs VPN**
### **Dark Web vs VPN**
- **VPN** emphasizes **privacy** by hiding what you do online.
- **TOR** emphasizes **anonymity**, hiding who you are online.
- A **VPN** encrypts your connection via a server you choose, while **TOR** routes traffic randomly through a series of servers.
