### Normal Permissions

- Access data or resources outside the app's sandbox with very little risk to privacy or other apps  
- Examples: Permission to set the time zone, access the internet  
- Automatically granted at install time by the system  
- Cannot be revoked

### Dangerous Permissions

- Access to private user data or resources that could affect user's stored data or other apps  
- Example: Permission to read contacts  
- User must explicitly grant permission at runtime  
- Can be revoked by the user

### Special Permissions

- Cover particularly sensitive areas  
- Example: *WRITE_SETTINGS*  
- System shows a detailed management screen to the user  
- Must be enabled manually in Settings  
- Can be revoked

### Permission Best Practices

- Always check permissions before installing an app  
- Deny additional permission requests during app usage unless absolutely necessary  
- **Red Flag:** Web browser requesting access to camera or microphone  
- Regularly review app permissions in phone Settings
