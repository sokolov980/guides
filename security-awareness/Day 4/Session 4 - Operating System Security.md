  - Missing or invalid privacy policy.
  - Installs boot-time startup items.

## Malware: A Greater Concern
- Data is more valuable than money â€” attackers seek any access.
- Over 250,000 new malware samples discovered daily.
- Malware often hides inside legitimate apps ("cleanware").
- "Hacking as a Service" and "Spyware as Software" business models emerging.

## Pegasus Spyware
- Developed by Israeli firm NSO Group Technologies.
- Installed via malicious links or exploit calls.
- Uses zero-click or click-based exploits (e.g., WhatsApp buffer overflow).
- Targets SMS, WhatsApp, iMessage, and unknown vulnerabilities.
- Capabilities:
  - Harvest SMS, emails, chats.
  - Access photos, videos.
  - Activate microphone and camera.
  - Record calls.
  - Track GPS.
  - Access calendar and contacts.
- **Impact in India:**
  - Over 40 journalists identified as targets.
  - Confirmed presence of Pegasus on devices of prominent Indian media personnel.

## Signs of Malware Infection on Smartphones
- Sluggish phone performance.
- Slow app loading times.
- Rapid battery drain.
- Excessive pop-up ads.
- Presence of unknown apps.
- Unexplained spikes in data usage.

## Parental Controls: Why Use Them?
- Control or block video games.
- Filter web browsers to show approved sites.
- Restrict usage of specific services.
- Manage search engines and video content filters.

### Setting Up Parental Controls on Android
