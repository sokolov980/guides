## **Incident Prevention**

### **Prevention and Precautionary Measures**
- Nomination of **Chief Information Security Officer**
- Information **Security Policy** & implementation of best practices
- **Business Continuity Plan (BCP)**
- **Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)**
- Security of **information infrastructure, network & applications**
- **Network traffic screening**
- **Isolation of critical networks**
- Implementation of **Security guidelines** issued by concerned authorities
- **Vendor Risk Management**
- **Supply Chain Risk Management**
- **Background checks**
- **Audit & Assurance**
- **Security testing & awareness**
- **Coordination & incident information sharing**

## **Cyber Security Assurance - Levels of Assurance**

| **Assurance Level** | **Description** | **Methods of Verification** |
|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| **Level 1** | Assurance of systematic approach to IT security | Organization is aware of IT security best practices and has defined and documented its IT security plan, policies, and procedures covering people, products, technology, and processes. | Questionnaire-based checklist and remote on-site desktop assessment of checklist response |
| **Level 2** | Assurance of compliance to IT security best practices | Organization has implemented IT security best practices based on a clear understanding of risks, threats & vulnerabilities, and the compliance has been verified by a self-assessment process or by an independent third-party auditing organization. | Self-assessment or third-party auditing |
| **Level 3** | Assurance of an adequate IT security posture | Organization has conducted IT security posture verification (by security testing, code walk-throughs, etc.) by an independent third-party auditing organization. | Security testing of IT infrastructure (e.g., VA/PT, application security testing, code walk-throughs) |
| **Level 3+** | Assurance of IT security crisis response & ability to resist cyber attacks | Organization has implemented its own **CCMP**. It has participated in cybersecurity exercises to test and verify its crisis response. | Cybersecurity exercises and CERT-In CCMP revision details |
| **Level 4** | Assurance of proactive IT security monitoring and mitigation of threats and vulnerabilities | The organization has implemented mechanisms for proactive IT security monitoring and mitigation (e.g., IPS/IDS, SIEM). | Technology-based monitoring (e.g., IPS/IDS, SIEM) evidenced in governance reports and management feedback |
| **Level 4+** | Assurance of proactive sharing and mitigation of IT security threats & vulnerabilities | The organization has implemented mechanisms for proactive sharing and mitigation (e.g., collaboration with CERT-In, sectoral CERTs, ISACs). | Collaboration with CERT-In, sectoral CERTs, ISACs evidenced in communication trails |
| **Level 4++** | Assurance of proactive prediction of residual IT security risks & attack paths and mitigation | The organization has mechanisms for predicting residual IT security risks and mitigating threats. | Attack path analysis |
