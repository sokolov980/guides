# Hacking & Exploitation Techniques

## Elements of Information Security

- Information security is a state of well-being of information and infrastructure in which the possibility of theft, tampering, and disruption of information and services is kept low or tolerable.
- Core principles:
  - **Confidentiality**
  - **Integrity**
  - **Availability**
  - **Authenticity**
  - **Non-Repudiation**

---

## Information Security Attacks – Goals, Motives & Objectives

- **Attack Formula**: Motive (Goal) + Method + Vulnerability
- **Motives** arise from the perception that a system contains something valuable:
  - Disrupting business continuity
  - Information theft
  - Data manipulation
  - Disrupting critical infrastructure to create chaos
  - Promoting religious or political ideologies
  - Supporting state military or espionage goals
  - Damaging reputation
  - Personal revenge

## What is Hacking?

- Exploiting vulnerabilities and compromising security controls to gain unauthorized access.
- Modifying system/application behavior for unintended purposes.
- Can result in IP theft, data breaches, or system compromises.

## Who is a Hacker?

- Intelligent individuals with excellent computer skills.
- May explore systems for knowledge, challenge, or malicious goals.

### Hacker Classes:

- **Black Hats** – malicious actors
- **White Hats** – ethical hackers
- **Gray Hats** – mix of good and bad
- **Suicide Hackers** – reckless, self-sacrificing
- **Script Kiddies** – use pre-made tools without full understanding
- **Cyber Terrorists** – ideology-driven destruction
- **State-Sponsored Hackers** – government-backed espionage
- **Hacktivists** – cause-based attackers

## Methods of Hacking

### Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)

- MITM is when an attacker secretly relays and possibly alters communication between two parties.
- Common in public Wi-Fi environments.

#### Attacker Capabilities:
- File tampering
- Redirecting traffic
- Logging user activity
- Exploiting open ports

#### Sniffing:
- Captures data packets across networks.
- **Passive Sniffing** (on hubs): only monitors.
- **Active Sniffing** (on switches): injects ARP traffic to overload CAM tables.

#### Active Sniffing Techniques:
1. MAC Flooding  
2. DNS Poisoning  
3. ARP Poisoning  
4. DHCP Attacks  
5. Switch Port Stealing  
6. Spoofing

#### Defenses Against Sniffing:
- Restrict physical access to network media
- Use encryption (SSL/TLS, SSH)
- Use static IP/ARP tables
- Disable broadcast services
- Switch to IPv6
- Secure ARP caches
- Enable encrypted sessions

---

### Spoofing

- Cybercriminal impersonation through falsified identity (IP, DNS, email, website, etc.)

#### Spoofing Detection:
- Unexpected requests or attachments
- Requests for sensitive information
- Suspicious domain mismatches
- HTTPS verification
- Obvious grammatical/spelling errors

#### Spoofing Prevention:
- Avoid clicking unknown links or attachments
- Use official login URLs
- Enforce HTTPS
- Use password managers and spam filters
- Enable 2FA

## System Hacking Goals

| Stage              | Goal                                         | Technique / Exploit Used               |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Gaining Access     | Bypass controls                              | Password cracking, social engineering |
| Privilege Escalation | Acquire admin/user privileges              | Exploiting vulnerabilities             |
| Executing Applications | Maintain remote access                  | Trojans, spyware, backdoors, keyloggers|
| Hiding Files       | Conceal activity or stolen data              | Rootkits, steganography                |
| Covering Tracks    | Remove evidence of compromise                | Clearing logs                          |

## Password Cracking & Attacks

- Used to gain unauthorized system access.
- Often succeed due to weak or default passwords.

### Attack Types:
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses wordlists.
- **Brute Force Attack**: Tries every possible combination.
- **Rule-Based Attack**: Uses known password patterns.
- **Default Passwords**: Exploits vendor default credentials.

---

## Trojans, Spyware & Keyloggers

- Malicious software that runs in the background and logs credentials.
- Sends stolen data to the attacker’s server.
- Often embedded in seemingly benign apps.

---

## Hacking Techniques

### Keylogging:
- Records every keystroke.
- Modern tools also take screenshots and hide within other processes.

### Cookie Stealing:
- Copies authentication cookies from a victim's browser.
- Lets attacker impersonate the victim.

### Denial of Service (DoS / DDoS):
- Overwhelms systems with traffic to make them unavailable.

#### Symptoms:
- Website unavailability
- Slow performance
- Increased spam
- Complete network disruption

---

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

- Injects malicious scripts into trusted websites.
- Exploits client-side code execution.
- Can steal session tokens or manipulate content.

---

## Attack Categories

### Application-Level Flood Attacks:
- Peer-to-peer abuse
- Permanent DoS attacks

### Protocol Attacks:
- SYN flooding
- ICMP floods

### Volumetric Attacks:
- Bandwidth overload
- Service request floods

---

## Session Hijacking

- Attacker takes over a valid session by impersonating one party.

### Common Techniques:
- IP Spoofing
- Packet sniffing
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Blind hijacking

### Mitigations:
- Encrypt traffic (IPSec, SSL, SSH)
- Secure cookies and session management
- Multi-layer security at both network and application levels
