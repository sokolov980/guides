# Cybersecurity: Understanding Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Defensive Measures

---

## Why Is Cybersecurity Important?

- Increased reliance on computer systems
- Exponential rise in the number of 'smart' devices
- Even non-traditional devices ("things") are connected via the Internet (IoT)
- Massive volumes of sensitive data are online
- Digital financial transactions are the norm â€” **money is online**

---

## Cybersecurity Goals

1. **Protect Confidentiality**
2. **Maintain Integrity**
3. **Ensure Availability**

## What is a Vulnerability?

A **vulnerability** is a weakness in a system that can be exploited to compromise its confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

### Types of Vulnerabilities:

- **Technology Weakness**: Bugs or flaws in software or hardware
- **Configuration Weakness**: Misconfigured settings, open ports, weak credentials
- **Security Policy Weakness**: Lack of enforcement or missing controls

### CVE System (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)

- **CVE ID**: Unique identifier for known security vulnerabilities
- Maintained by the **MITRE Corporation**
- Assigned by **CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs)**
- Provides a common language for discussing, identifying, and tracking vulnerabilities

## Anti-Virus Software

- Detects and prevents malware infections
- Downloads updated virus definitions from the vendor
- Matches file hashes against known malware signatures
- Premium features may include:
  - Web threat protection
  - Identity theft protection
  - Real-time scanning
- **Must be regularly updated**
- **Free AVs** offer basic protection; advanced features are usually behind a paywall

## Phishing Attacks

A method of tricking individuals into revealing sensitive information by impersonating a legitimate source.

### Characteristics:

- Email appears to come from a trusted source
- May contain:
  - Malicious links
  - Requests to fill out forms
  - Fake phone numbers to call

### Example: Tax refund phishing emails or SMS

### Consequence:

- Victim enters data on a fraudulent website
- Leads to **identity theft**

### Prevention Tips:

- Inspect email address and sender domain carefully
- Do **not** click unknown or suspicious links
- Hover over links to inspect their destination
- Manually type the URL in the browser
- Avoid filling out forms inside emails

---

## Malicious Email Attachments

- Attachments may contain malware
- Common formats: `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.exe`, `.zip`, etc.
- Attackers exploit curiosity or urgency to get users to open files

### Defense:

- Open only when you're **certain** of the sender's identity
- Verify through a separate communication channel

---

## Honey Trap Attacks

A social engineering technique where attackers gain trust and manipulate victims, often for spying or malware delivery.

### Tactics:

- Posing as an interested friend or admirer
- Engaging with victim casually (likes, comments, chats)
- Sending links to malware disguised as:
  - Photos
  - Games
  - "Gifts"

### Goals:

- Install spyware (e.g., keyloggers or screen capture tools)
- Steal sensitive data
- Identify further targets through the victim's contacts

## Self-Audit: Search Yourself

Perform regular personal security audits.

### Actions:

- Search your name in quotes: `"Your Full Name"` on Google/Bing
- Check for unexpected or outdated public images or data
- Review your social media:
  - Who can view your posts?
  - Are there unknown people in your friends list?
- Re-check privacy/security settings:
  - Profile visibility
  - Tagging settings
  - Data sharing with third-party apps

### Evaluate PII Exposure:

- Avoid displaying:
  - Phone numbers
  - Addresses
  - Location check-ins
  - Work schedules

---

## Security Best Practices

- Every bit of personal data can be exploited
- Use **Incognito/Private Mode** when browsing on shared devices
- **Never sign in** on untrusted public systems
- **Disable auto-play** for USB devices
- **Scan** USB drives before accessing contents

### Password Hygiene:

- Use unique, random passwords for every account
- Password should be **at least 16 characters**
- Include **uppercase**, **lowercase**, **numbers**, and **symbols**
- Use a **cloud password manager** (e.g., LastPass, Bitwarden, 1Password)
- Change passwords **at least once per year**
- **Enable 2-Factor Authentication (2FA)** on all supported platforms
