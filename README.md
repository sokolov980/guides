## Requirements

- Firefox browser (latest version)
- Terminal access and basic familiarity with commands

## Disclaimer

These configurations are privacy-focused and may reduce convenience or break compatibility with some features, applications, or websites. Use them as a base and adapt to your personal threat model.
