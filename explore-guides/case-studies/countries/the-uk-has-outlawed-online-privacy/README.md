# The UK Has Outlawed Online Privacy

The UK government has officially ended meaningful online privacy with the implementation of the **Online Safety Act**, a law originally drafted in 2023. The act is presented as a way to “protect children and adults online,” according to the [official government explainer on gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/online-safety-act). However, in practice, it expands surveillance powers, undermines anonymity, and forces online platforms to collect more personal information than ever before.

## 1. What the Online Safety Act Does

The act requires online platforms to:

- Prevent children from accessing harmful or age-inappropriate content.  
- Provide clear tools for parents and children to report problems online.  
- Verify the age of users before granting access to certain types of content.

While this might sound reasonable in theory, in practice it means websites will have to **verify user identities**—often by checking government-issued IDs—before allowing access. This eliminates online anonymity and creates vast new databases of personal information ripe for abuse.

## 2. The Privacy Problem

To enforce age verification, platforms will need to confirm exactly who users are. This destroys one of the core principles of online privacy: the ability to explore information freely and anonymously.  
The implications are significant:

- **Loss of anonymity:** Every user could be required to link their real identity to their online behavior.  
- **Data exploitation:** Companies already known for aggressive data collection, like Google and Meta, will gain access to even more personal details.  
- **Risk of identity theft:** Centralized databases of ID information create new targets for hackers and data brokers.  

For example, Google already logs your search queries and ties them to your IP address and approximate location. But if identity verification becomes mandatory, Google will know *exactly who you are*, linking your face, home address, and browsing habits into one unified profile. This would be an unprecedented invasion of privacy.

## 3. Why VPNs Won’t Save You

Some might assume that using a VPN could help bypass these restrictions by making it appear that they’re connecting from another country. However, many companies, including YouTube and Google, have already begun blocking access for users they detect as using VPNs or proxies.  
Under the Online Safety Act, companies can justify this as “compliance with UK law,” effectively outlawing VPN use for privacy purposes.

In short:

- VPNs may be blocked outright.  
- VPN detection systems are improving rapidly.  
- Even if a VPN works temporarily, it may soon be blacklisted.

This leaves ordinary users with fewer tools to maintain privacy online.

## 4. A Misguided Focus on “Protecting Children”

The UK government claims the law is about protecting children from harmful content. But instead of addressing serious real-world issues like grooming gangs and child exploitation, the focus is on regulating online speech and access to information.  
While shielding minors from explicit material is a valid concern, the methods chosen are disproportionate and ineffective. Blocking adult content through ID checks will not stop children from finding explicit material online. Instead, it creates an illusion of safety while eroding everyone’s privacy.

For context, the **State of Virginia** in the US passed a similar law requiring age verification to access adult sites. The result was predictable: only major platforms like Pornhub or XHamster complied, while countless smaller and potentially illegal sites continued to operate freely. These smaller sites, often hosted in countries with weak oversight, pose far greater risks for both users and victims of exploitation.

## 5. Why Blanket Censorship Doesn’t Work

Attempting to block all explicit or “harmful” content on the internet is an impossible task. Studies estimate that up to **30% of all internet traffic** is related to adult content in some form.  
To fully enforce such restrictions, the government would have to take drastic steps, such as deep-packet inspection or national firewalls—approaches more in line with authoritarian regimes than open democracies.

Even if the goal is to protect children, no amount of regulation can replace **parental responsibility**. Parental involvement, device supervision, and education are far more effective than government censorship.

## 6. A Better Approach for Parents

If the intent is to protect children, parents should take direct, practical steps instead of relying on the state:

- **Use local content filters** on home Wi-Fi routers.  
- **Supervise device use.** Avoid leaving children alone with unrestricted internet access.  
- **Communicate openly** about online risks.  
- **Set digital boundaries** rather than outsourcing control to government agencies.

Technology cannot replace parenting, and the government cannot legislate good supervision into existence.

## 7. The Consequences for Adults

For adults who value privacy and freedom of access, the Online Safety Act represents a significant regression. Being forced to verify your identity before viewing content or conducting searches turns the open web into a controlled environment.  
Every click, search, and view could soon be linked directly to a verified identity. This information can be shared with advertisers, data brokers, or even government agencies.

Once ID-based verification becomes the norm, anonymity online will effectively cease to exist in the UK.

## 8. Possible Workarounds and the Future

If these restrictions become more aggressive, the future of private internet use in the UK may depend on **offline communities** and **local networks**. Privacy enthusiasts could organize **LAN-based data exchanges** or small-scale information-sharing networks to maintain access to uncensored information.

Data hoarders and archivists will likely become valuable members of local communities, sharing knowledge and preserving access to content that might otherwise disappear behind government filters.

## 9. Conclusion

The UK’s Online Safety Act may have been introduced with the intention of protecting children, but in practice, it eliminates privacy, expands corporate surveillance, and increases government control over speech and information.  
True online safety comes from **education, parental guidance, and user awareness**, not mandatory ID checks or mass surveillance. The solution is not more government control but a return to responsible individual behavior and community-level trust.
