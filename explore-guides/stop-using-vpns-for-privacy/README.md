# Stop Using VPNs for Privacy

This guide explains why commercial VPNs are not the privacy solution they claim to be, how they can expose you to new risks, and when using one might still make sense. It also covers common misconceptions, the dangers of cheap self-hosted VPNs, and safer alternatives.

## 1. Overview

VPNs are marketed as tools that make you anonymous online. In reality, they don’t. A VPN simply shifts trust from your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to the VPN company. It can hide your browsing activity from your ISP, but the VPN provider can see everything instead. If that provider keeps logs or gets hacked, your traffic can still be exposed.

VPNs have some legitimate uses, but they are not a catch-all privacy solution. Understanding what they do — and what they don’t — is key.

## 2. What a VPN Actually Does

A VPN creates an encrypted connection between your device and a remote server. From there, your traffic continues to its final destination. In simple terms:

- Your ISP can’t see what websites you visit, only that you’re connected to a VPN server.  
- The VPN provider can see your activity unless it’s already encrypted (for example, HTTPS).  
- You still reveal your real IP address to the VPN when you connect.  
- Your privacy depends entirely on how much you trust the VPN company and the country it operates in.

## 3. Why Most VPNs Are Problematic

- **You’re just moving the problem.** Instead of trusting your ISP, you now have to trust your VPN provider — and often with even less transparency.  
- **“No logs” doesn’t mean no logs.** There’s no reliable way to verify those claims. Audits are rare, limited, or outdated.  
- **They can still be hacked.** The 2018 NordVPN server breach showed that even big-name providers can get compromised.  
- **They can be forced to hand over data.** Many VPNs operate in countries where they’re legally required to share user information, often under secret court orders.  
- **They can become honeypots.** Some providers intentionally log user data to sell it or share it with law enforcement.  
- **They attract extra scrutiny.** Many websites block known VPN IP addresses, and your ISP can still detect VPN traffic patterns.

## 4. Why VPNs Don’t Make You Anonymous

VPNs do not hide your identity when you log into accounts tied to your real name, email, or phone number. Once you sign in to something like Google, Instagram, or Twitter, your traffic can easily be linked back to you. Other reasons include:

- **Traffic correlation:** Observers watching both ends of your connection can match patterns to identify you.  
- **Metadata leaks:** Timing, packet size, and destination data often reveal more than you think.  
- **Provider trust:** VPN operators (or their governments) can secretly log and monitor activity.  

If anonymity is your goal, VPNs simply aren’t designed for that.

## 5. The NordVPN Example

In 2018, NordVPN confirmed that one of its servers was compromised for over a month before being discovered. While the company said no user credentials were leaked, this proved that even well-known VPNs are not immune to breaches. A single compromised server can expose a large volume of user data before detection.

## 6. The Problem With Self-Hosted VPNs

Some users try to avoid commercial VPNs by renting a cheap VPS (virtual private server) and hosting their own. While this can be more transparent, it still comes with serious issues:

- **OpenVZ-based VPS risks:** Many low-cost VPS providers use OpenVZ, a container-based system where all users share the same kernel. The host can see your processes, files, and memory in real time. Encryption is basically impossible in this setup.  
- **Outdated kernels:** Many OpenVZ hosts still run kernels from 2009 or earlier, which contain hundreds of known vulnerabilities and don’t support modern software like Docker or WireGuard.  
- **Overprovisioning:** Cheap VPS hosts often oversell capacity, leading to throttling or account suspension if you use too many resources.  
- **Same trust issue:** Even if you self-host, the VPS provider still controls the physical machine and can access your data if compelled.

If you insist on self-hosting, use a KVM- or Xen-based VPS, and choose a provider outside invasive legal jurisdictions. Still, this won’t make you anonymous — it just moves the point of trust.

## 7. When VPNs Actually Help

There are valid, limited cases where a VPN makes sense:

- **On public Wi-Fi:** Protects against local snooping at cafes, airports, and hotels.  
- **In censored regions:** Helps bypass local firewalls and government restrictions.  
- **At work or school:** Hides your browsing from administrators on a monitored network.  
- **For torrenting (in hostile regions):** Masks activity from ISPs that penalize torrent traffic.

These are situational use cases — not general privacy improvements.

## 8. Better Alternatives

If privacy and anonymity are your goals, there are better options:

- **Use Tor for anonymity.** Tor routes your traffic through multiple relays, making it difficult to trace. It’s slower but far more effective for anonymity.  
- **Use HTTPS everywhere.** Encryption at the application level (e.g., HTTPS, Signal, ProtonMail) protects data regardless of your network.  
- **Compartmentalize your identity.** Keep separate browser profiles or devices for sensitive and personal use.  
- **Consider SSH tunnels.** For simple private routing, SSH tunneling is often safer and more transparent than VPNs.  
- **Don’t mix activities.** Avoid logging into personal accounts while trying to stay anonymous.

Privacy depends more on behavior and encryption than on routing traffic through a different server.

## 9. If You Still Need a VPN

If you absolutely must use a VPN, follow these guidelines:

- **Pick a provider with independent audits and transparency reports.**  
- **Avoid free VPNs.** They often sell user data to advertisers or data brokers.  
- **Understand the jurisdiction.** Choose a provider based in a country with strong privacy laws and minimal data-sharing agreements.  
- **Separate identities.** Don’t use personal accounts while connected to a “privacy” VPN session.  
- **If self-hosting, use KVM or Xen.** Avoid container-based hosts like OpenVZ entirely.  
- **Combine tools.** Use end-to-end encryption, secure browsers, and compartmentalized accounts for layered protection.

## 10. Conclusion

VPNs can be useful tools, but they are not magic. They simply shift who can see your data from your ISP to the VPN provider. For true anonymity and strong privacy, use tools like Tor, apply encryption at every level, and adopt disciplined browsing habits. Treat VPNs as a situational security tool, not a permanent privacy solution.
